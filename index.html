        <h1>Bathala Coin (BTHLA) — Whitepaper</h1>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Bathala Coin (BTHLA) is a mythology-powered memecoin born from the idea that even the ancient gods would’ve loved a good pump. Inspired by Bathala — the OG creator of the universe — we bring Filipino folklore into the modern digital arena through memes, hype, and community energy.</p>

        <p>BTHLA isn’t here to lecture with long mythology lessons. Instead, we turn Philippine mythological icons into fun, iconic, shareable moments that anyone around the world can vibe with.</p>

        <p>Think of it as cultural storytelling compressed into:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Memes</li>
            <li>Art</li>
            <li>Characters</li>
            <li>Lore drops</li>
            <li>Community jokes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We don’t force people to learn mythology — we make them <b>want</b> to, because the imagery is cool, the memes are fire, and the vibe is legendary.</p>

        <h2>2. Cultural Mission</h2>
        <p>BTHLA was created with one core mission:</p>

        <p><b>Make Philippine mythology cool again.</b></p>

        <p>Not through lectures.  
        Not through academic presentations.  
        But through community energy, storytelling, and meme culture that fits the new generation.</p>

        <p>We aim to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Celebrate Filipino identity in a fun, accessible way</li>
            <li>Reintroduce mythological characters through memes and digital art</li>
            <li>Inspire pride and creativity</li>
            <li>Showcase Filipino folklore globally</li>
            <li>Make mythology enjoyable without requiring formal study</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We’re not trying to be historians — we’re here to hype our heritage in the most iconic way possible.</p>

        <h2>3. Community</h2>
        <p>The BTHLA community is grounded in a simple truth:</p>

        <p><b>There are still Filipinos who value integrity — both in Web3 and in real life.</b></p>

        <h3>Community Governance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Every major project decision involves the community.</li>
            <li>No secret changes.</li>
            <li>No silent updates.</li>
            <li>No decisions behind closed doors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Transparency of Creator Fees</h3>
        <p>All creator fees from trades will be publicly documented and used for:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>DEX promotions</li>
            <li>Boosts</li>
            <li>Collaboration fees</li>
            <li>Raffles</li>
            <li>Community events</li>
            <li>Marketing pushes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>No hidden wallets. No shady allocations. Everything is open for the community to see.</p>

        <p>BTHLA isn’t just a meme — it’s a movement built on values, culture, and honesty.</p>

        <h2>4. Future Plans</h2>
        <p>As BTHLA grows and the team secures more resources, we plan to expand beyond the memecoin itself.</p>

        <h3>Upcoming Major Project: NFT Collection</h3>
        <p>The collection will explore:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Deities</li>
            <li>Mythical creatures</li>
            <li>Folklore characters</li>
            <li>Cultural symbols</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All reimagined in a modern, Web3-friendly, meme-powered style.</p>

        <p>The NFT collection aims to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Educate</li>
            <li>Entertain</li>
            <li>Preserve cultural heritage</li>
            <li>Engage global audiences</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Team</h2>
        <p>We are a small Filipino team working with limited resources — but maximum passion.</p>

        <p>We believe transparency, consistency, and execution matter more than showing our faces.</p>

        <p>We promise:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>To give our best effort</li>
            <li>To grow BTHLA</li>
            <li>To build a strong community</li>
            <li>To represent Philippine culture in a fun, global way</li>
        </ul>
