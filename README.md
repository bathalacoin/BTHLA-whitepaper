1. Introduction

Bathala Coin (BTHLA) is a mythology-powered memecoin born from the idea that even the ancient gods would’ve loved a good pump. Inspired by Bathala — the OG creator of the universe — we bring Filipino folklore into the modern digital arena through memes, hype, and community energy.

BTHLA isn’t here to lecture with long mythology lessons or textbook-style explanations. Instead, we turn Philippine mythological icons into fun, iconic, shareable moments that anyone around the world can vibe with. Think of it as cultural storytelling, but compressed into:

Memes

Art

Characters

Lore drops

Community jokes

We don’t force people to learn mythology —
we make them want to, because the imagery is cool, the memes are fire, and the vibe is legendary.

2. Cultural Mission

BTHLA was created with one core mission:

Make Philippine mythology cool again.

Not through lectures.
Not through academic presentations.
But through community energy, storytelling, and meme culture that fits the new generation.

Philippine mythology is filled with creators, warriors, guardians, goddesses, and cosmic beings — but only a handful are widely known. BTHLA changes that by reintroducing these figures using modern digital culture.

We aim to:

Celebrate Filipino identity in a fun, accessible way

Reintroduce mythological characters through memes and digital art

Inspire pride and creativity

Showcase Filipino folklore globally

Make mythology enjoyable without requiring formal study

We’re not trying to be historians.
We’re just here to hype up our heritage in the most iconic way possible.

3. Community

The BTHLA community is grounded in a simple truth:

There are still Filipinos who value integrity — both in Web3 and in real life.

In a space filled with rug pulls, scams, and chaos, BTHLA aims to be a symbol of transparency and honesty.

Community Governance

Every major project decision will involve the community.

No secret changes

No silent updates

No decisions behind closed doors

If it affects the project, the community gets a voice.

Transparency of Creator Fees

All creator fees from trades will be publicly documented and used for:

DEX promotions

Boosts

Collaboration fees

Raffles

Community events

Marketing pushes

No hidden wallets.
No shady allocations.
Everything is open for the community to see.

BTHLA isn’t just a meme —
it’s a movement built on values, culture, and honesty.

4. Future Plans

As BTHLA grows and the team secures more resources, we plan to expand beyond the memecoin itself.

Upcoming Major Project: NFT Collection

We plan to develop a full NFT collection inspired by Philippine mythology, featuring:

Deities

Mythical creatures

Folklore characters

Cultural symbols

All reimagined in a modern, Web3-friendly, meme-powered style.

The NFT Collection Aims To:

Educate

Entertain

Preserve cultural heritage

Engage global audiences

This will represent the next phase of the BTHLA ecosystem, expanding both its cultural reach and community engagement.

5. Team

We are a small Filipino team working with limited resources — but maximum passion.

Many projects rely on being doxxed to appear trustworthy, but we believe that showing our faces doesn’t guarantee anything in Web3. What matters more is:

Consistency

Transparency

Execution

Community involvement

We won’t promise unrealistic things.
What we will promise is:

We will give our best effort to grow BTHLA, build the community, and represent Philippine culture in a fun, modern, global way.
